# OLY

This project was our first contact with Laravel Framework and PHP and development in general. It was done, during our fourth semester of studying at the Witelon State Univeristy of Applied Sciences in Legnica, to pass a course called "Web Systems - Design and Programming I"

It is meant to be our version of the very popular, polish announcement service called "OLX".
